# Mergers-and-Acquisitions-Sourcing

Machine learning (ML) models can analyze financial statements, internal and external data, market trends, and online sentiments to narrow down potential targets for M&A. After preliminary targets are identified, the models screen applicants to focus on best fit. 
For example, ML models can rank preliminary targets based on their growth potential or their financial value, allowing teams to focus on the highest-value targets first. 
Models can use historical data to anticipate future outcomes in key performance areas, such as revenue or return on investment. Applying predictive analytics to the target is a form of scenario forecasting. This accelerates decision-making for firms by simulating potential challenges and rewards of going after targets.

I want to take an approach that creates strategic advantages for investment banking, private
equity, and venture capital firms. The core pillars of my sourcing model include strategic fit,
buying/selling power, and risk to determine how well companies are aligned based on complementary products, services, technologies, and culture. For
identifying buying power, the model includes features for market capitalization, cash flow,
debt capacity, credit rating, and industry multiples. For identifying selling power, the model 
considers financial performance, growth potential, market share, unique assets, and competition
landscape. There is potential to expand on valuations including intangible assets like data as
competitive advantages for firms. The model applies weights to risks such as probability of
new products entering the market or market disruption and patent frequency and frivolity to
determine level of competition. In addition including factors that consider a targetâ€™s regulatory
environment and geographic location. This modeling approach allows for more granular data,
higher accuracy, and in-depth feature development.
